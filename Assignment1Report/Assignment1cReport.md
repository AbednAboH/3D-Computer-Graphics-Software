## section 1 :
with the right view volume :

with view volume changed non proportional values:

with view volume changed whilst keeping the correct ratio :

changes: 
* Changes are made on left right top and bottom ,changes on near and far do not change the outcome of the image:
 * between first and second images the result shows that if we chose (left,right) ,(top,bottom) not within the right ratio we get a narrower or wider view of the object/
 * between first and third images the result shows that if we keep the correct ratio the only thing that would change is the size pf the object ,in other words it was compressed more so the convertion to the world gives a bigger objcet . 

## section 2 :
  * on a 2k monitor at full screen with resolution 2650 x 1440 (2650 x 1415 not counting the upper bar ):

  * on a 2k monitor with a smaller window:

# sanity check :
   * the sanity check is the demo object because it's symmetrical and we can identify if it was streched or not ,
      then i downloaded a cube object for it's more reasonable to see if it streches out or not because it's a cube :

## section 3 :
  
* in the video we can see that the axis of the model move with it and that the axis of the world do not change unless we move the camera .

the axis of the model remain fixed to the model's directions (moves/rotates acordingly),
even when i rotate the world they move with the model keeping the model's directions correct in proportion to to the world .  
the axis of the world do not change unless i change the camera's location.

## section 4

* T1-> move\translate  x  ,T2 -> rotate y 
  *  T1 on model frame then T2; rotating the world rotates the object around the center of the world 
  *  T1 on world frame then T2 on model frame rotates the model around itself 
 
## section 5: 
  * the steps to the solution :
    * found the min,max point's for the model , and i used them to creat a cube , as an example :(Xmax,Ymax,Zmax) is a point , i created a 3d cube using vertixes comprized from the min/max of the points and then applied the same Transformations that i've applied on the model 
    * i calculated the normals through a function in mesh model using  (v2-v1)x(v3-v1) and then normalized it , after all that i calculated the vertix normals from the faces .

* a cube is perfect for this kind of test because its a cube exactly like our bounding box and we can see in the video that the bounding box fits perfectly on the edges of the object 
* it also allows us to see that the normals are proportionate and not too big and not too small because the cube is exactly the size of the bounding box  

## section 6:
 * in the following video we show that in ortogonal the cube stays in the same size even when we move it along the axis and even when the camera gets close or far from it .
* on the other hand perspective shows that the object gets smaller when it gets closer to the axis and gets bigger when it gets closer to the camera

here we show that when we translate the z axis or move the camera in it, the object gets smaller in perspective view whilest in the orthographic view it remains the same :

## section 7 :
* I implemented Perspective using glm::perspective , in the following video i show the difference between the camera getting closer to the object and changing the field of view (fovy):

* when the camera gets closer to the model the model looks like i'm looking at it with my eye ,meening the model looks bigger and it's shape looks a little more streched out ,exactly working as an eye 
*  on the contrary changing the field of view looks like i took a snap shot of the object and the object's shape doesn't change at all .


## section 8 :
  results in moving the object :

in the camera frame the object moves clock wise ,in the world fram the mesh moves counter clock wise , it behaves exactly like a miror 

## section 12 +13 :
 * main menu :
   * contains :
    * Transformations : opens a window of transformation on the model 
    * camera and fov : opens controles on the camera , field of view ,and an option for the camera's own transformations (local and world)
    * bounding box  : draws the bounding box 
    * Normals per vertix/face : draws the normal on each respectivly
    * object axis /world axis : draws the axis 
    * snap axis : snaps the models axis to the world axis 
  * Camera transformations :
    * select perspective or orthogonal view 
    * control on left right near far for orthogonal view  , doesn't apply on perspective 
    * move camera x,y,z moves the camera's location 
    * Camera transformations opens the camera transformations 
  * color options for bounding box ,normals and object and the background .
additional features :
   * w,a,s,d + cntrl/ alt  rotates around world / local for the model
